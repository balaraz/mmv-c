# mmv-c ðŸ“¦

![Build](https://github.com/mcauley-penney/mmv-c/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Edit file and directory names in `$EDITOR`. Inspired by [itchyny/mmv](https://github.com/itchyny/mmv).

## usage

- `mmv` will open the arguments you pass it, files or directories, in a temporary buffer where you can give new names

- It will also handle cyclical renames, should the desire arise
