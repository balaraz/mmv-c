# mmv-c ðŸ“¦

Edit file and directory names in `$EDITOR`. Inspired by [itchyny/mmv](https://github.com/itchyny/mmv).


#### usage

Like other command line tools, `mmv` accepts wildcards and special paths, such as `..`


#### installation

1. Clone this repository and enter the repo directory
2. Issue `make`, then `sudo make install`
3. Feel free to remove the cloned repo

In all:
```
git clone https://github.com/mcauley-penney/mmv.c.git
cd mmv.c
make
sudo make install
cd ..
sudo rm -r mmv.c
```

#### about
I like and frequently use the base functionality of the original, linked above. I've implemented something like it before [in shell](https://github.com/mcauley-penney/mmv.sh) and wanted to try my hand at a C implementation.

This version forgoes some of the features of the original that I don't use and don't need, such as cyclical renaming. See it for a more featureful experience.
